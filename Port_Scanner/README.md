A simple port scanner written in Go.

The program accepts an ip address or hostname of either a local or remote Linux machine as a parameter argument and returns a list of available ports on that machine.

Either run the program with 'time go run main.go (arg)', or compile with 'go build main.go' then execute the Go binary.  'time ./main (arg)'.
